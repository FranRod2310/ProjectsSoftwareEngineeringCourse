## Management info
### Sprint Planning Meeting: 
At the beginning of this week, the Scrum team met to plan and organize the work related to the Mindustry repository extension. Since this is a particularly busy week for all team members due to multiple tests and academic deadlines, the main focus of the meeting was time management and task organization rather than feature definition. 
During the meeting, the team decided the following:
- The **Scrum Master** was chosen and assigned the responsibility of managing deadlines and overseeing team coordination.
- The **remaining members** will continue exploring the Mindustry game and developing potential **user stories** for the upcoming sprint.
- Once these user stories are completed, the team will meet again to **decide who reviews what** and ensure quality before implementation.
### Sprint Review Meeting: 
*(Held at the end of the sprint, this meeting is attended by all stakeholders to demo the completed work and validate if the sprint goal has been met.)*

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting: 
*(This meeting happens after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning meeting. The team reflects on what went well, what needs improvement, and how to enhance their processes for future sprints.)*
