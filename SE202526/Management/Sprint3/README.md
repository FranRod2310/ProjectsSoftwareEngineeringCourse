## Management info
### Sprint Planning Meeting: 
In our meeting this week, we defined the following work for this sprint.
Unfortunately this sprint overlaps with academics tests period. To mitigate this risk, we agreed that if any of us have a delay due to tests must be communicated immediately so the team can adapt and redistribute tasks if necessary. For the same reason we decided to do just the tasks related with code smells.

Tasks:
- each member will identify and document 3 code smells;
- each member will review 3 code smells from 3 different colleagues;

### Sprint Review Meeting: 
*(Held at the end of the sprint, this meeting is attended by all stakeholders to demo the completed work and validate if the sprint goal has been met.)*

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting: 
*(This meeting happens after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning meeting. The team reflects on what went well, what needs improvement, and how to enhance their processes for future sprints.)*
