### Sprint Planning Meeting: 
Today, November 3rd, we held a team meeting to start our next sprint. The last two weeks have been challenging, balancing work and tests. Now, evaluations are over and we can catch up to speed.

The team agreed on the following goals for this week:

- Each team member will **identify 3 different Design Patterns** in the base code. Each member will then review 3 other patterns documented by other members (prioritizing diversity in reviews).

- Each team member will **write a Codebase Metrics Assessment report**. We distributed the available metrics, one per member without repetition. Afterwards, each one will review one other report.

- Each team member will **build at least one Use Case Diagram**, and review at least one other.


### Sprint Review Meeting: 
As Sprint 4 comes to an end, we held a meeting to talk about what was achieved and if all goals for the week were met.

At the start of the sprint, we set individual goals for each team member. By Friday, all goals were met.

Each member did its part responsibly, communication was strong, and the sprint is now finished.

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting: 
Looking back and comparing Sprint 3 with the sprint we just had, we can agree that things went smoother.

The work load this sprint was almost 3x bigger than last week, but we all had more available time. To account for this, work started right away on Monday.

Each member worked on their reports, communicating with the rest of the team each time a report was concluded, and always asking for feedback when in doubt of anything.

Despite this, the work load was still heavier on the latter half of the week. We made progress, but the work load could still be better distributed throughout the week.

Next sprint marks the start of Milestone 3, and we are now past the half-way mark of the project. Along these sprints, we believe we've made progress on our work ethic and have gotten more communicative as a team. 

We will strive to keep up and even improve our work ethic and keep working well as a team.
