## Management info
### Sprint Planning Meeting: 
Today, November 3rd, we held a team meeting to start our next sprint. The last two weeks have been challenging, balancing work and tests. Now, evaluations are over and we can catch up to speed.

The team agreed on the following goals for this week:

- Each team member will **identify 3 different Design Patterns** in the base code. Each member will then review 3 other patterns documented by other members (prioritizing diversity in reviews).

- Each team member will **write a Codebase Metrics Assessment report**. We distributed the available metrics, one per member without repetition. Afterwards, each one will review one other report.

- Each team member will **build at least one Use Case Diagram**, and review at least one other.


### Sprint Review Meeting: 
*(Held at the end of the sprint, this meeting is attended by all stakeholders to demo the completed work and validate if the sprint goal has been met.)*

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting: 
*(This meeting happens after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning meeting. The team reflects on what went well, what needs improvement, and how to enhance their processes for future sprints.)*
