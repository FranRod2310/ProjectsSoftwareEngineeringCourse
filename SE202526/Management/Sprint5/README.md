## Management info
### Sprint Planning Meeting: 
At the beginning of this week, the Scrum team met to plan and organize the first sprint of Milestone 3, focusing on the
preparation of the design and documentation required before code implementation. Since this milestone will last three weeks,
the team decided to dedicate this first sprint mainly to updating user stories and designing the system extensions at a high level.

During the meeting, the team decided the following:

- This week’s focus will be on:
  - Updating the user stories to reflect the new functionalities that will be implemented.
  - Creating the use case diagrams and their textual specifications following the lecture template.
  - Starting work on the class diagrams and sequence diagrams for each use case — these do not need to be finalized this week but should have an initial version ready (if possible).

No code implementation will be done during this sprint. The goal is to ensure all documentation and designs are ready for development in the next sprint.


### Sprint Review Meeting: 
*(Held at the end of the sprint, this meeting is attended by all stakeholders to demo the completed work and validate if the sprint goal has been met.)*

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting: 
*(This meeting happens after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning meeting. The team reflects on what went well, what needs improvement, and how to enhance their processes for future sprints.)*
