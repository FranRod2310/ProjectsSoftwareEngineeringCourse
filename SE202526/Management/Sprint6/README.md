### Sprint Planning Meeting: 
We held this week’s meeting and discussed the following topics: 
- When we plan to have the first version of the user stories implemented
- Who will be responsible for each task
- How we are going to review each other’s work

Our goals for this week are: 
- To have the first working version of each user story implemented, so we can focus on refining and improving what needs to be addressed in the following weeks
- To review each other's work to ensure everyone is aware of the overall progress and to minimize the probability of bugs

### Sprint Review Meeting:
