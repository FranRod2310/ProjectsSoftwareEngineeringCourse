## Management info
### Sprint Planning Meeting: 
We held this week’s meeting and discussed the following topics: 
- When we plan to have the first version of the user stories implemented
- Who will be responsible for each task
- How we are going to review each other’s work

Our goals for this week are: 
- To have the first working version of each user story implemented, so we can focus on refining and improving what needs to be addressed in the following weeks
- To review each other's work to ensure everyone is aware of the overall progress and to minimize the probability of bugs

### Sprint Review Meeting: 
*(Held at the end of the sprint, this meeting is attended by all stakeholders to demo the completed work and validate if the sprint goal has been met.)*

### Sprint Retrospective Meeting: 
*(This meeting happens after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning meeting. The team reflects on what went well, what needs improvement, and how to enhance their processes for future sprints.)*
