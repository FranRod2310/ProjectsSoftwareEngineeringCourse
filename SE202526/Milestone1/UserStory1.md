### User story

As a player, I want to have access to a sandbox mode (free play) so that I can freely experiment with different constructions and strategies without enemies or attack waves.

#### Notes

The sandbox mode is accessible from the main menu, as a new option alongside existing modes.

****In this mode:****
- No enemies or attack waves occur.
- The player can choose any existing map.
- The player has infinite resources or an increased resource generation rate.
- The game displays the text “Sandbox Mode” in the interface to indicate the current mode.
- The goal is to allow the player to test factories, production lines, and energy systems without restrictions, functioning as a training and experimentation mode.
