### User story

*As an experienced player I think we should have a greater diversity of towers that can help us automate the way we defend orders*

#### Notes

*Increase defensive automation and strategic variety, not just raw power*

#### Towers ideas:

- Enemy Priority Tower (Towers can prioritize targets (fliers, bosses, fast units) automatically)
- Support Tower (A tower that gives a damage boost to the nearby towers)


### Review
We find this user story very clear and focused on improving gameplay depth. The new tower concepts are intersting and bring new gameplay possiblities for more experienced players, keeping them hooked.
