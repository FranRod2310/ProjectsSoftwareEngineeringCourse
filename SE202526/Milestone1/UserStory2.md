### User story

*As an experienced player I think we should have a greater diversity of towers that can help us automate the way we defend orders*

#### Notes

*Increase defensive automation and strategic variety, not just raw power*

#### Towers ideas:

- Enemy Priority Tower (Towers can prioritize targets (fliers, bosses, fast units) automatically)
- Support Tower (A tower that gives a damage boost to the nearby towers)
