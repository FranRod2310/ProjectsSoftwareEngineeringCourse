### User story

As a brand new player to Mindustry, I want a more intuitive game tutorial so that I don't get lost and demotivated.

#### Notes

For example, it's not always clear what material is required just by an icon. 
Adding the material name would simplify things and leave new players less frustrated.

### Review

It’s a clear and focused user story that effectively addresses a real onboarding issue for new players, helping them connect with the gameplay and, later on, with the story.
