##  MOOD Metrics Report - Review

**Reviewer:** Leandro Rodrigues - 68211

The report does a good job at explaining the different metrics available in MOOD.
It begins by talking about expected values for each metric, which is usefull for analysing the results of the project.

The chart produced is simple and effective to read. Even tough there is little results obtainable from the MOOD metrics, i'd still like to have the used spreadsheet for examining potential graphs.
Therefore, I reccomend adding the Excel file to the folder too.

Moving on to the Mindustry analysis, the report goes over each of the metrics in good detail.
After reading the brief explanation in the beggining, it's intuitive to look at these results.

Each metric result is well looked at, pointing out places where the values go out of normal ranges, followed by a well-strucutered analysis of such values.

The conclusion, relating the metrics to potential code smells fits well with the overall project and is well related.

Overall, the report is well-written, and I would only add the Excel file to the folder.
