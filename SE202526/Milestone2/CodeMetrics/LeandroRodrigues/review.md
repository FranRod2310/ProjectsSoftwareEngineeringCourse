# Review - Complexity metrics

**Reviewer**: Miguel Rosalino 68210

The metric set is well introduced, simple and effective. The table is a good way to present the informations on the different metrics.
The desired values and references are clear and important for following analysis.

The presented graph works for the values studied at the method level, and it's values are well interpreted and explained
The graph for class level works the same, and those are also well explained.

The analysis of other metric levels is a good addition and complements the report well.
However, since most values are similiar they could be condensed into a single explanation.

Lastly, some reformating suggestions for troublesome values could be added.
