### Review - Lines Of Code Metric

## Reviewer: Francisco Rodrigues 67753 

The report shows a clear and organized analysis of the Lines of Code metric at both method and class levels.
The introduction explains the purpose of LOC metrics, and what the results can mean.

The visual graphs are well chosen and easy to interpret, clearly showing the extreme values across methods and classes.
The identification of the extreme methods in the chart such as Blocks.load() and UnitTypes.load() is accurate, and the proposed refactoring suggestions are practical and well reasoned.
The section on Comment Lines of Code (CLOC) also explains well the relation between heavy commenting and method complexity. 
Which sometimes come together to make it seem that it is easy to understand while it should be seperated in different methods.
The deodorant code smell is, therefore, well identified.

At the class level, the detection of potential God Classes is correct, since it has a clear relation with these metrics.
The conclusion summarizes the results clearly.

In conclusion, the report is detailed with everything needed to understand this metrics and the possible problems in the code.
