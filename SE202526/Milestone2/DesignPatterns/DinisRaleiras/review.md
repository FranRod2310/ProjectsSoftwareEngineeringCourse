## Design Pattern 1

**Reviewer:** Filipe Nobre 67850

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**
Overall, the review is well done. It correctly identifies `arc.Events` as the Subject and `FogControl´ 
as an Observer, explains event registration and firing, and highlights benefits like low coupling and extensibility. 
The code examples illustrate implementation well, 
and while a brief usage example could improve clarity, the explanation is clear and accurate.
