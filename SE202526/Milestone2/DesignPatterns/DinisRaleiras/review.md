## Design Pattern 1

**Reviewer:** Filipe Nobre 67850

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**
Overall, the review is well done. It correctly identifies `arc.Events` as the Subject and `FogControl` 
as an Observer, explains event registration and firing, and highlights benefits like low coupling and extensibility. 
The code examples illustrate implementation well, 
and while a brief usage example could improve clarity, the explanation is clear and accurate.

## Design Pattern 3

**Reviewer:** Luís Muacho 68301

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**
The diagram shows us how `GameState` acts like a Facade, serving as an access point centralized to many components of the subsystem.
The Rationale precisely identifies the pattern and articulates perfectly its purpose, simplifying interactions with the subsystem (`Rules`, `Teams`, etc).
The benefits that are mentioned are exactly the main results that this pattern purposes to deliver. 
So overall, the identification of this pattern seems correct and precise enough.
