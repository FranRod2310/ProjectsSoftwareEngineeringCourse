**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**

The identification of the **Factory Method** pattern in the `Blocks` class is accurate and well justified.
The explanation correctly highlights how the `load()` method centralizes the creation and initialization of all block objects in the game, such as conveyors, drills, cores, and turrets.
Each block type inherits from the abstract `Block` class, which defines the base structure and shared behavior, fitting the intent of the **Factory Method** pattern.
