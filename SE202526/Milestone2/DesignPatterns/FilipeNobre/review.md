## Design Pattern 1

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**

The identification of the **Factory Method** pattern in the `Blocks` class is accurate and well justified.
The explanation correctly highlights how the `load()` method centralizes the creation and initialization of all block objects in the game, such as conveyors, drills, cores, and turrets.
Each block type inherits from the abstract `Block` class, which defines the base structure and shared behavior, fitting the intent of the **Factory Method** pattern.

## Design Pattern 2

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**
The Rationale for this pattern is correct, it precisely identifies the class `Vars` as a Singleton container, which is an exact description of its function.
The justification correctly points to the `static` members as the main evidence. This guarantees that there is just one instance of each critical subsystem, which is managed by the `Vars` class.
The benefits are precisely the results of this type of pattern, so they are correctly identified. 
Finally, the diagram is simply but represents what we need to see about this class with this pattern.
So overall, this identification seems correct, meets all the bullet points, and is well done.
