## Design Pattern 1

**Reviewer:** [Leandro Rodrigues] [nº68211]

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**
Comments:
- Perfect and clear identification of the Facade pattern.
- ContentLoader acts as the Facade, and ImagePacker is the Client.
- The ContentLoader successfully hides the complexity and loading order of multiple subsystems (e.g., Items.load(), Blocks.load(), Planets.load()) behind a simple method (createBaseContent()).

Points to be corrected:
- None. The analysis is very strong, accurate, and well-justified.

Suggestions:
- No suggestions are necessary; the analysis is complete and very well-written.
