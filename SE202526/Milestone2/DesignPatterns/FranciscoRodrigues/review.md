## Design Pattern 1

**Reviewer:** [Leandro Rodrigues] [nº68211]

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**

Comments:
- Perfect and clear identification of the Facade pattern.
- ContentLoader acts as the Facade, and ImagePacker is the Client.
- The ContentLoader successfully hides the complexity and loading order of multiple subsystems (e.g., Items.load(), Blocks.load(), Planets.load()) behind a simple method (createBaseContent()).

Points to be corrected:
- None. The analysis is very strong, accurate, and well-justified.

Suggestions:
- No suggestions are necessary; the analysis is complete and very well-written.

## Design Pattern 2

**Reviewer:** [Leandro Rodrigues] [nº 68211]

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**

Comments:

- The design pattern was well identified. The implementation clearly shows the use of a centralized state management
- system that controls the game’s flow between different states (paused, playing, menu).

Points to be corrected:
- None. The analysis is very strong, accurate, and well-justified.

Suggestions:
- No suggestions are necessary; the analysis is complete and very well-written.


## Design Pattern 3

**Reviewer:** [Miguel Rosalino] [68210]

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**
The code snippet illustrates the Singleton design pattern, and the code location is shown.
The class diagram is accurate and straightforward.
The Rationale checks out and well justifies the design pattern being a singleton.
Overall a solid analysis.
