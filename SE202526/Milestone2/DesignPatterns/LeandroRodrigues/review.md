## Design Pattern 1

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**

The template pattern is well identified, and clearly the case. The classes below the abstract class use the template given by the abstract class, adding it's own logic to some cases. The class diagram is also well made, it shows that `DrawCircles`, `DrawFade` and `DrawGlowRegion` depend on the template given by `DrawBlock`. The rationale is also valid, it explains why this pattern can be useful in this case.
