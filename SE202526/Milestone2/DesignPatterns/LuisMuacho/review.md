## Design Pattern 1

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**

The identification of the **Facade Pattern** in the `AsyncCore` class is correct.  
The class provides a unified and simplified interface for managing asynchronous processes while hiding the complexity of Java’s concurrency system.  
It coordinates two subsystems — the internal game processes (`AsyncProcess`) and the Java concurrency API (`ExecutorService`, `Future`) — through clear methods like `begin()` and `end()`.

Overall, this is a **well-applied Facade Pattern** that effectively reduces system complexity, improves decoupling, and enhances maintainability in the Mindustry codebase.
