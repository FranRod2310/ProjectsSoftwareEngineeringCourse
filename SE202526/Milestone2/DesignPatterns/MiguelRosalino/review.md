## Design Pattern 1

**Comments/Points to be  corrected/Sugestions:**

The identification of the **Memento** pattern in the `SaveSlot` class is correct and well explained.
The mapping of the roles — **Originator**, **Memento**, and **Caretaker** — matches how the saving system in `Mindustry` works.
`SaveSlot` acts as the memento, storing the game’s snapshot data, while the originator is the game world that generates and restores its state.
The caretaker, represented by the `Saves` class, controls when the game state should be saved or loaded.
This design correctly applies the **Memento** pattern because it allows the game to save and restore its state without exposing internal details.
