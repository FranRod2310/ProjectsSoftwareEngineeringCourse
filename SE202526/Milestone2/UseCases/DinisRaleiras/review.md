The 5 use cases found are valid. The description explaines briefly in what it consists. The actors are also well identified, and some use cases have an extra mentioning the related use cases.
The diagram is also weel designed, it shows clearly what each actor does and it is easy to understand. The only thing is that the actor World System has no role in the use case diagram, so it could be deleted.
