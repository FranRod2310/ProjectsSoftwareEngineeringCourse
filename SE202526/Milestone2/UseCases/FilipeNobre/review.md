## Review Use Cases
### Reviewer: Luís Muacho 68301

The 5 use cases are well-done; the descriptions are short and very clear and specific. The Actors (Primary and Secondary) are clear and seems sufficient. And the related use cases are great, referring not only to use cases from this model but also to external use cases.
About the diagram, it's a little confusing, but it's understandable as it's necessary to represent all the use cases mentioned. 
Overall, a well done and interesting Use Case Model.
