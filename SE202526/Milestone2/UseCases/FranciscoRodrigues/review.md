# Review

The Research Tree System is a good choice and is well explored.
The actors are appropriate and their roles as main and secondary are well designated.
Each of the 5 developed use cases has the requested information (name, brief description, main/secondary actors).
The use case diagram follows the use cases mentioned, and the <<includes>> relationship makes sense.
The <<includes>> relationship could be briefly mentioned and justified in the Navigate Search Tree UC explanation.
Overall, it's a well-written and well-strucutred use case diagam analysis.
