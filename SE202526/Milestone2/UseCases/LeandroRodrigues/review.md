# Use Case Diagram - Review

**Reviewer**: Miguel Rosalino 68210

Additional gampeplay is a good topic for developing a use case diagram and is well introduced.

The use case names are well given and describe utility well.

The use case descriptions are brief but descpritive, and the primary / secondary actors are well attributed.

The table is a nice summary and the diagram follows the structure described. 

The imports make sense, but could be explained in more detail during the use case descriptions.
